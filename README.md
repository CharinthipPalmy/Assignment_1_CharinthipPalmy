# FinTech Case Study
## The Fintech company
When fintech emerged in the 21st century, the term was initially applied to the technology employed at the backend systems of established financial institutions, such as banks. From 2018 or so to 2023, there was a shift to consumer-oriented services. Fintech now refers to the integration of technology into offerings by financial services companies to improve their use and delivery to consumers.[1]

## _Airwallex_
Airwallex company is one of fintech companies in Australia, which was established in Melbourne 2015,Australia by five co-founders.[2] At the time, software engineer Jack Zhang and architect Max Li had invested into a coffee shop which they were operating in Melbourne. While importing supplies from China, they found cross-border payments to be costly and time-consuming for a small company. Zhang, involved in designing the digital forex trading platforms for the National Australia Bank (NAB) and The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ), was inspired to provide a simple, cheaper service to small and midsize businesses. Zhang and Li partnered with Lucy Liu and Xijing Dai, fellow alumni from the University of Melbourne, as well as Ki-Lok Wong. With the founders investing a combined $1 million, roles included Zhang as CEO, Liu as president, Li as head of design, Dai as chief technology officer, and Wong as principal architect.

### Landscape
##### _Online Payment Domain_
Long queues at the bank are a pain in the neck for most consumers. Despite the provision of online banking, there are still queues at the bank due to the limitations of the online services.

The total eradication of physical contacts for banking transactions seemed far-fetched until the pandemic hit. Accessing funds virtually became a survival need that conventional banking could not meet completely. A [McKinsey study][df1] showed that digital payment is one of the biggest fintech products. New generation financial institutions rose to the occasion by leveraging fintech solutions to offer convenient digital-only banking services that required no physical contact. The growing competition among financial institutions in offering digital-only banking services is good news to consumers as they have an array of enticing offers to choose from. As a massive of online-banking companies including banks, all are playing in the red-ocean indutry.[4]

### Recommendations

### Challenging 
- The regime it operates under, which is set out in The Payment Systems (Regulation) Act, is now 25 years old and did not envisage the rapid pace of development in the fintech sector during the past decade.[5]
- The regulator watches Airwallex’s growth closely and has been keen to engage with the firm about its business model and the size of balances customers have in their e-wallets.
- The prudential regulator asked Airwallex to do two things. First, apply to become a licensed purchased payment facility. And second, take out bank guarantees over its customer balances.
